<b>Ballistic model of an accretion disk</b>

Taking into account the classical concepts of the 3-body problem and using the theorems of theoretical mechanics, it is possible to create a system of differential equations of motion for each component of the system:

```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```
